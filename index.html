    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am a Senior ML Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.turing.com/">Turing</a>, where I work at the intersection of software engineering and modern AI systems.
      I contribute to the development of agentic platforms that automatically evaluate and verify agentic tasks. The Turing mission is to help frontier AI research labs and enterprises advance model capabilities.</p>

    <p>I have 7 years of industry experience across a range of roles and domains. I began my career as a full-stack developer at <a href="https://en.hinzaco.com/">Hinza Co</a>, 
      then joined <a href="https://tapsell.ir/en">Tapsell</a>, Iran’s largest mobile advertising network handling over 50 million daily requests. At Tapsell, I worked as a software and data engineer before being promoted to a technical leadership role.
      Before Turing, I was a software engineer at <a href="https://www.waveapps.com/">Wave HQ</a>, a financial platform serving over 2 million small business owners, where I worked on building robust backend systems for critical risk-assessment workflows.
    </p>
    
    <p>I hold an MSc in Computer Science from the <a href="https://contacts.ucalgary.ca/info/cpsc/profiles/1-10050603">University of Calgary</a>, completed under the supervision of <a href="https://contacts.ucalgary.ca/info/cpsc/profiles/102-3636">Professor Robert Walker</a>.
      My master’s thesis, "Graph Generalization in Software Engineering", focused on practical applications of novel graph-based algorithms for large-scale software repositories (<a href="https://github.com/mreza-kiani/graph-generalization-algorithm">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2674-113X/4/4/33">journal</a>).
      I earned my BSc in Software Engineering from the <a href="https://ut.ac.ir/">University of Tehran</a>.</p>
