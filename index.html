    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I'm currently studying my MSc in Computer Science at
      <a href="https://contacts.ucalgary.ca/info/cpsc/profiles/1-10050603">the University of Calgary</a>,
      under the supervision of
      <a href="https://contacts.ucalgary.ca/info/cpsc/profiles/102-3636">Professor Robert Walker</a>.
      My master's thesis, titled "Graph Generalization in Software Engineering", focuses on the practical applications
      of an innovative graph-based algorithm within software repositories.</p>
    <p>My journey in computer science began with a BSc in Software Engineering from the
      <a href="https://ut.ac.ir/">University of Tehran</a>.</p>
    <p>I have 5 years of experience working in the industry as a software engineer. I started my professional experience by
      working at <a href="https://en.hinzaco.com/">Hinza Co</a> for 3 years as a full-stack developer. Then I joined
      <a href="https://tapsell.ir/en">Tapsell</a>, the largest mobile advertising network in Iran with more than
      50 million daily requests. I started as a software and data engineer for the first 18 months, and then I was
      promoted to a technical leader position.</p>
    <p>My interest is in designing and developing scalable, high-performance systems driven by cutting-edge software
      engineering methodologies and a commitment to crafting quality code, guided by the principles of clean code.</p>
    <p>I'm a fast learner, always passionate for opportunities to explore new technologies and techniques,
      and further enhance my knowledge and skills. I've also developed strong communication and leadership skills through
      my professional and volunteer experiences.</p>
